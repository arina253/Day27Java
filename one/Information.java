Website and Web-application

In web application,we can communicate with system.
Communication can be done in 4 different ways:
	CRUD- CREATE,RETRIEVE,UPDATE,DELETE

	Operations created by developer.
	QA person verify/test if these operations are working as expected.

	
	QA
	Doing work mostly around web application
	Mobile, native or web application
	Work around CRUD operations
	
	Testing can be done in 3 different layers:
		Structure
		Any application have client,server and database.
	

//CLIENT-------------SERVER------------------DATABASE

//CLIENT:
		Different view
		whatever  we see in front end/application  or user interface-client.
		
 eg.Web Browser- html,css,javascript(language)
 Mobile application
 ipad- swift language


//SERVER
Logic is written
back end language- python, JAVA,C#, Node js,ruby

DATABASE
Oracle,mongoDb,mysql,postgres,nosql





//TESTING
Functional testing : We are testing on 3 layers:
	Test on client: test on mobile app, web browser or tabs
	
	UI Testing is done by Selenium
	Back end testing by API,  logic via  rest assured
	
	Database testing  by rest assured or manually by hitting SQL queries
	
	Tester need to work on UI Testing/UX Testing
	               Back end layer by API testing
	               Whatever the back end is returning corrctly shown in front end
	               known as integration testing
	               Integration between back end and front end known as end to end 
	               testing- testing the application as per the user
	
	All these four things can be achieved with a tool known as Selenium/Web driver/
	Rest assured/SQL
	
	Selenium: 
		Library
		 API jar file- functions are already written
		 Product of thought work team
		 Our role:
			 Used the function to run the SCRIPT
			 
			 Why Selenium?
					 
					 Selenium  can be used for UI testing,
					 
					 Selenium  comes with multiple  language
					 
					 Python
					 c#
					 javascript
					 java
					 out of these, we are learning JAVA with the purpose of automation-regression testing
					 
					 
					 We need to pick a language to write selenium script.
					 Selenium is mostly written with JAVA
					 
					 Why JAVA?
							 To write  selenium script
							 
						Why Script?
						     To do 4 types of testing-
							 UI/API/INTEGRATION & END-END TESTING
							 
							 JAVA- CORE JAVA
							 Has good community support.
							 JAVA is completely object oriented.
							 
							 Why is automation required?
									 For regression testing-the newly implemented feature has no effect on existing functionalities.
									  Manually: Time consuming,
									  
									  The sole purpose of automation is Regression testing.
									  
									  There are different tools for automation and out of these,we are using Selenium.
									  
									  API: Communicates between database and client.
									       Translator (eg. waiter)
									 
							 
					 
		
	//TYPES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
									       INBUILT DATATYPE
									       INTEGER-complete number
									       BOOLEAN-hold two values,true or false
									       STRING-
									       FLOAT
									       CHAR
									       DOUBLE
									       LONG
									       SHIRT

									       USER DEFINED DATATYPE
									       We can create our own datatype like car,person,orders,invoice
									       Have properties and methods (action)

//-compiler ignore
									       
//system.out.println(x);-------For printing
//Shortcut:Type syso and press/hold CTRL and press SPACE
									       
//In Java, we have the following functions to print anything in the console.

System.out.print() and
System.out.println()

But there is a slight difference between both of them, i.e. 

System.out.println() prints the content and switch to the next line after execution of the statement whereas 

System.out.print() only prints the content without switching to the next line after executing this statement.
									       
//System.out.print prints the output without a newline, 
//System.out.println prints the output with a newline character at the end. 
//The choice between them depends on whether you want to print multiple outputs on the same line 
(System.out.print) or start a new line for each output (System.out.println).
									       
									      
//public static void main(){

//CTRL+SHIFT+F---Formatting

//Red button in right hand side in display console is termination button-if program running repeatedly.

//There should be no same variables
//If we use variable,we can reuse it again and again.

//If you want to remove the red highlighting and activate the old program code, 
//you need to remove the commenting symbols or modify the code structure to ensure it is executed as intended.


//Modulus:give remainder values

//MAIN METHOD: We need to define the variable, 
               // we need to print the variable
               // we need to do arithmetic operation with the variable
//Repeatation of writing operations again and again


//FUNCTION:
To execute same set of operations/code repeatedly, we have to write functions
//FUNCTION CALLING - should be inside main method 
//(ie. inside the curly brace of main method)


//WRITING FUNCTIONS - should be outside the main method and within the class 
//(ie. outside the curly/close braces of main method and before the close brace of class)
//public static void SHAM(GREENTEA){
//INSTRUCTION: ARITHMETIC OPERATOR----System.out.println();


//void------Function will not return anything
//Return;-----stored in a variable

//Click WINDOW------SHOW VIEW-----PROJECT EXPLORER

//Static keyword is not required while creating method in other class
