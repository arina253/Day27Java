		 List.of() method
		to create an immutable list 
		we cannot add, remove, or modify elements after its creation. 
		If you need a mutable list that you can modify, you would typically use the 
		ArrayList class from the java.util package.


		.collect(Collectors.toList())
		 used in combination with the Stream API and the Collectors class to collect the
		 elements of a stream into a List.


********************************************************************************
*
*In Java, the collection hierarchy is a set of interfaces and classes provided 
*in the java.util package to work with collections of objects.
*
*1)Collection Interface (java.util.Collection):
* This is the root interface of the collection hierarchy. 
* It defines the basic methods that all collections should have, such as 
* add, remove, size, isEmpty, contains, and iterator.

--List Interface (java.util.List): Extends the Collection interface and represents
an ordered collection of elements. 
Implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector. Lists allow duplicate
elements and support indexed access.

2)Map Interface (java.util.Map):
 This interface represents a collection of key-value pairs. 
 It does not extend the Collection interface but is an important part of the Java
  collection framework.

-HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap: 
These classes implement the Map interface. HashMap provides fast retrieval but 
does not guarantee order. 

3) Iterator and Iterable Interfaces (java.util.Iterator and java.lang.Iterable):

 These interfaces are not part of the collection hierarchy directly, but they
  play a crucial role in working with collections. Iterator provides a way to 
  iterate over the elements of a collection, 
  while Iterable is used to indicate that a class can be iterated over.
